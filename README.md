# library-ToP
This is a project from The Odin Project named "Project: Library"

I'll use this read me file as place to stored the Problem solving approach.

First we need the HTML structure of all the elements needed:

Let's do a Header with the name and a book counter

Then, we need the content which is a button to add new books & the grid to stored the books.

Now, let's work on the logic of JS and the event listener & class structure to stored the book data.

We also need a dialog box that contains the Form that's gonna be display when the "add book button" is clicked.

The form must contain title, author, pages, year and read status.

We need to get the data from the form and stored using the class structure.

Created a button that when clicks runs the gathering data process and restores the form inputs to default / 0.

The submit button will also activate a function that modifies the DOM with a block of the Grid contaning the form input data.

When the DOM gets another grid object/div it will update the counter from the header to keep count of the total amount of books in the Library (DOM).

Add another button to cancel the adding a book dialog.

Add another button to reset the inputs fields to default/ 0 to restart.
